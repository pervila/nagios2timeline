TESTING document for Nagios2Timeline
====================================

Unit testing
============

Some rudimentary unit testing has been sketched in the
``test_Nagios2Timeline.py'' module. Unfortunately, the methods designed for
the program module itself lend themselves somewhat poorly to unit testing.
Further tests could be written as the development progresses.

Instead of more thorough unit testing, the Nagios2Timeline module has been put
to a rather extensive Integration (Systems) test.


Integration testing
===================

Nagios2Timeline.py has been put to a very realistic test by letting it
operate on a total size of 82 MB worth of Nagios logs collected by the CS
Department's sentinel services. The tool is able to parse through the complete
archive in about 35 seconds, which is an acceptable benchmark for a high-level
systems tool.

During operation, warnings are issued whenever host or service recoveries
with no corresponding previous malfunctions are encountered. However, these
warnings are results from changes to the underlying Nagios sentinel service, 
and therefore not faults of the Nagios2Timeline program. The program can
silently discard any such warnings or print them to the user in verbose mode.

Each of the command line parameters have been run and the outputs verified.
Some bugs were discovered in the final stages through this method. They have
been documented in the README file.
